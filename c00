2-#include <unistd.h> :
means that your C program is including the header file unistd.h, which gives you access to a set of POSIX
(Portable Operating System Interface) system calls and constants.
This header is available only on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS), not on Windows by default.

char *str = "Hello";       // String literal (read-only)
char str2[] = "Hello";     // Modifiable array

3-integer devision :
In C, integer division (/) discards the remainder. For example:
    If nb = 42, then 42 / 10 = 4.
    If nb = 123, then 123 / 10 = 12.
